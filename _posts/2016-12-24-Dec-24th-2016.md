> **How to make sense of 2016** <br/>
FOR a certain kind of liberal, 2016 stands as a rebuke. If you believe, as *The Economist* does, in open economies and open societies, where the free exchange of goods, capital, people and ideas is encouraged and where universal freedoms are protected from state abuse by the rule of law, then this has been a year of setbacks.
