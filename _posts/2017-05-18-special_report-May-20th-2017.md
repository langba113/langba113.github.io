> **Six days of war, 50 years of occupation** <br/>
IN THE BEGINNING they destroyed Egypt’s air force on the ground and knocked out the planes of Jordan, Iraq and Syria. That was Monday. Then
they broke Egypt’s massive defences in Sinai. That was Tuesday. Next, 5 they took the old city of Jerusalem and prayed. That was Wednesday.
Then they reached the Suez Canal. That was Thursday. They ascended
the Golan Heights. That was Friday. Then they took the peaks overlook-
ing the plain of Damascus. In the evening the world declared a ceasefire.
That was Saturday. And on the seventh day the soldiers of Israel rested.
